# About:
# This mapping translates specific ECO codes to GAF evidence codes. This is automatically generated
# based on `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/eco/gaf-eco-mapping.txt`, which maps the GAF evidence
# code to its equivalent ECO term, and the hiearachy of ECO. The lines that contain "Default" in the
# third column are these equivalent mappings. All other ECO IDs are descendants of the "Default".
#
# Each mapping line contains:
#  1. GAF evidence code (e.g. IEA)
#  2. ECO ID
#  3. Default (optional), if the ECO ID is equivalent to the GAF evidence code
#
# This document consists of these comments (after #s) followed by a set of mappings,
# each represented as the above 3 columns separated by tabs.
#
# For example ECO:0006075 'affinity evidence used in manual assertion' maps up to IPI because it is
# a child of ECO:0000353 'physical interaction evidence used in manual assertion', which is
# equivalent to IPI
