def: "A type of differential staining evidence where crystal violet is used as the primary dye and safranin is used as the counterstain. The stain is named after Hans Christain Gram who developed it in 1894 while working with Carl Friedl√§nder in the Berlin city morge. The gram stain is used to separate bacteria into two major categories gram positive and gram negative, gram positive having thick peptidoglycan and the gram negative having thin peptidoglycan. The protocol for the stain is an application of the crystal violet followed by Gram's iodine as the mordant, ethyl alcohol as a decolorizer, and safranin as the counterstain." [ECO:KAV, PMCID:PMC180726]
comment: The original formula for the gram stain consisted of aniline-gentian violet, iodine-potassium iodide, absolute alcohol, and sometimes bismark brown.

def: "A type of capsule staining evidence where. Congo red and a combination of acetic acid and acid-fuchsin are used to view bacterial capsules. The staining procedure is to put droplets of congo red on a slide and mix with a sample from culture. The slide must air dry and not be heat fixed. The congo red is a PH indicator and it dries on the slide leaving a red background then manval's solution a mixture of acetic acid and acid-fuchsin is added to the slide. The acid-fuchsin stains the bacteria bright red and the acetic acid acts as a mordant." [ECO:KAV, PMID:19239855, PMID:23825728]
comment: Congo red is a pH indicator and changes color when exposed to different pH. It is blue below 3.0 pH and will turn red if exposed to a pH above 5.2. Due to this when a maneval's stain is done the slide shows red white and blue red and blue for the background while the bacteria is stained red by the acid fuchsin the capsule remains white. The slide must be rinsed at the end and not blot dried because of the same reason it cannot be heat fixed because those actions would destroy or damage the destroy the capsule.

However it has been shown that other microorganisms can coagulate mammalian plasma as well. The test works due bacterial protein production of coagulase which allows fibrinogen to be converted to fibrin." [ECO:KAV, PMID:14255647, PMID:18905247, PMID:2185284, PMID:6808014]
comment: There are two subtypes of coagulase test one is done on a slide the other is done in a tube. The slide can give fast results, but often false positives. The tube can take up to 24 hours for results but is generally more accurate.

The media was created by Starr in 1941, other medias of the time did not allow for the growth of certain organisms because the types of dyes used was too toxic. Starr solved this by using spirit blue as the base dye. The agar media also contain a lipase reagent a mixture of tributyrin and polysorbate 80 as well as yeast extract, B-complex vitamins, and peptone as a source of carbon , nitrogen, and other vitamin's." [ECO:KAV, PMID:17748334, PMID:24274015]
comment: The original media formula consisted of 30g agar, 10g  tryptone, 5m yeast extract, 250 ml of 20% cotton seed oil emulsion, 50 ml of 0.3 % alcholic solution of spirit blue, and 1000 ml of distilled water to make. Other lipodial emulsions can be created by using meal, cream , vegetable oil, or olive oil.

def: "A type of selective solid agar medium evidence originally used for the cultivation of the Legionella species. The agar media contains yeast extracts, charcoal activated, ACES buffer, l-cysteine hcl, and a-ketoglutarate monopotassium salt." [ECO:KAV, PMID:2116452, PMID:393713, PMID:7009642, PMID:9780107, PMID:PMC265402]
comment: The media has been modified many times over the years. Legionella pneumophila was first discovered in 1977 by MacDade et al. In 1979 Feeley et al developed a medium that provided consistent isolation of Legionella. He later modified that media by replacing casein hydrolase with yeast and beef extract. In 1980 Pasculle et al added the ACES buffer giving the media the designation BCYE ( buffered charcoal yeast extract). During 1981 Edelstien et al. Increased the sensitivity of the media by adding alpha-ketoglutaric potsasium salt. During that same year the media was made even more selective for Legionella by Wadowsky and Yee by adding the antibiotics glycine, vancomycin, and polymyxin. The latest modification was made in 1984 by Dennis et al. By adding cycloheximide creating GVPC medium.  \n\nIn recent studies the agar media has been shown the ability to culture other species of microorganisms including Brucellae, Nocardia and Acanthamoeba keratitis.

def: "A type of histological staining evidence where toluidine blue a cationic metachromic dye that has a high acid affinity binds to tissues rich in nucleic acids." [ECO:KAV, PMID:15728881, PMID:18926341, PMID:22923899]
comment: Toluidine blue is composed of tolonium chloride. The dye is catonic and binds to proteoglycans as well as glycosaminoglycans\nThe dye is also metachromatic, through a property called metachromasia the color of the dye changes when it binds to particular tissue substances called chromotropes. The dye can also experience a change in color due to ph differences within tissue. The dye is commonly used to stain mast cells and cartilage but because. It stains cells and tissues rich in nucleic acids it has applications in a plethora of fields including cancer research, gastrointestinal research, bactericidal research, and forensic research.

comment: Picosirus red must be viewed under polarized light. Under the light collagen appears green, red, or yellow. The stain works because collagen is rich in basic amino acids and will react to the dye.
